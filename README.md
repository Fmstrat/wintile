# WinTile: Windows 10 window tiling for GNOME

WinTile is a hotkey driven window tiling system for GNOME that imitates the
standard `Win-Arrow` keys of Windows 10, allowing you to maximize, maximize
to sides, or 1/4 sized to corner a window using just `<Super>`+`<Arrows>`.

WinTile also supports:
- 1-5 columns for standard or ultrawide monitors
- 1-5 rows for standard or ultrawide monitors
- Mouse preview and snapping for placing tiles
- "Maximize" mode, which adds/removes GNOME animations
- Ultrawide-only mode allows 16:9 screens to use separate row/col counts
- Portrait screens will automatically swap columns and rows
- Adding gaps around tiles
