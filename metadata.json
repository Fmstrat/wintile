	"description": "WinTile is a hotkey driven window tiling system for GNOME that imitates the standard Win-Arrow keys of Windows 10, allowing you to maximize, maximize to sides, or 1/4 sized to corner across a single or multiple monitors using just Super+Arrow.\n\nAs of v10, WinTile also supports:\n- 2, 3, or 4 columns for standard or ultrawide monitors\n- Top/bottom half support\n- Mouse preview and snapping for placing windows\n- 'Maximize' mode, which adds/removes GNOME animations\n- 'Ultrawide-only' mode, to limit standard screens to 2x2 while allowing ultrawides to still have 3 or 4 columns.\n- Add gaps around tiles to avoid the 'crowded elevator' feeling'.",
